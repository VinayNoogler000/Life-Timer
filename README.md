## 🚀 Project Description

Life Timer is designed to provide a live display of a user's age, down to the second, by calculating the time elapsed since their birth. This project showcases fundamental web development skills and features a clean, responsive design.


### Features

1. **Dynamic Age Timer:** Enter your Date of Birth, and watch your age (in Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds) update every second.
2. **Responsive Design:** Utilizes CSS FlexBox, Grid, and Media Queries to ensure a seamless experience across all device sizes.
3. **Interactive UI:** Includes a settings icon that toggles the visibility of the DOB input field and the Add-DOB button, complete with a smooth rotating animation.
4. **Background Video:** Features a beautiful background video that changes to an rotating-earth video upon submitting the DOB.
5. **GitHub Integration:** A GitHub icon that links directly to the project's repository.


### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout using FlexBox, Grid, and Media Queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** Logic to calculate and display the age, handle form submission, and update the timer.


### Learnings

1. **Background Video Change:** Implemented video background changes based on user interaction.
2. **Age Calculation:** Developed logic to calculate age using DOB and the current time.
3. **Page Refresh:** Utilized `window.location.reload()` to refresh the webpage when needed.
4. **Code Optimization:** Improved code efficiency by reducing repetitiveness and using functions.
5. **Code Documentation:** Added comments to explain important parts of the program for better understanding and maintenance.
